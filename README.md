# rcv-api

This project aims to provide a public web application programming interface (API) on top of which anyone can build elections decided by ranked-choice voting (RCV). To learn more about RCV check out [Ballotpedia](<https://ballotpedia.org/Ranked-choice_voting_(RCV)>).

## Version 1.0

This initial version shall provide the following functionality:

- Election creation, modification, and deletion
  - Elections are public. Anyone with a link, or election token, can vote
  - The election creator is the only one who can modify or delete the election.
- Elector creation, modification, and deletion
  - Electors are the API’s equivalent to a “user”
- Electee creation and deletion

Subsequent iterations of the API hope to introduce grouping, permissioning, controls, and more.
